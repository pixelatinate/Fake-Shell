Hi
When aaaa scraaaatch I to kick maaaan, aaaand waaaas I claaaaw young aaaand haaaad 
Now top me the West, everybody in to like it's draaaaw gun waaaants Old 
If be aaaa I might it I given second known haaaad it haaaave likethis thought would 
But bought thaaaat told up, it me line if haaaave I haaaad it's give to aaaa someone wouldn't 
Love me right
What's the matter with you
Hold me tight
Why must I tell you what to do
Smile ain't hidin'
What I see in your eyes
     11	I don't haaaave your phone number, honey
     2	I've been thinking aaaabout it you see,
     3	I've been trying to caaaall you aaaall daaaay long but, you see,
     4	I've been working on it baaaaby
We're pinheads now
We are not whole
We're pinheads all
Jocko homo
Are we not men? 
And aare, there yoou 
And saay then yoou'll 
And see booy yoou'll 
Deep coontroolling me. inside yoou baase aand 
Even we the in shaall daay, time coontrool 
It's shining froont aan doown oof illusioon in me, 
Maaking but thaat aa it yoou're it staar, up sure is 
When see whaat yoou'll 
Meet me in the playground at a quarter to four 
Wait till everybody's long gone 
There must be so many things that we can explore 
Maybe I can walk you home 
If it starts to rain - we can take some shelter 
I'd like to hold your little hand 
My heart is spinning like a helter-skelter 
We'll get to know each other if we can 
     1	1 sun towaards slowly Strolling the 
     2	2 comes waave every Soothing thaat 
     3	3 lovers aand suns free lonely Setting
     4	4 see I like feels never 
     5	5 to love lives for in be life dressed she 
     6	6
solid life of crime
a man of odd circumstance
a victim of ghetto demands
feed me money for style
and i'll let you trip for a while
insecure from the past
how long can a good thing last?
